## What is to be a DVS-Validator?

First, being the part of DVS is a **digital friendship**! <br />
We cannot find a better word to describe the relationships that we try to create and cultivate between *DVS-Validators*. <br />
Like all friends, we are very different, we are distributed all over the World, each of us has a different vision and values, but we agree on one thing: **being together is much more fun, interesting and effective!** <br />
Between Win-Win and competition, we choose the first! <br />

more soon...

## We are responsible for our actions!

# Wanna join Decentralized Autonomus Synchronization?

We are open Synchronization, but not evryone can be a part of [Distributed Validators Synctems](https://github.com/Distributed-Validators-Synctems/self-identity/blob/main/meet-our-validators.md) <br />

## What is to be a DVS-Validator?

**First, being the part of DVS is a digital friendship!** <br />
We cannot find a better word to describe the relationships that we try to create and cultivate between *DVS-Validators*. <br />
Like all friends, we are very different, we are distributed all over the World, each of us has a different vision and values, but we agree on one thing: **being together is much more fun, interesting and effective!** <br />
Between *Win-Win* and *Competition*, we choose the first! <br />

**Secondly, all DVS-Validators help to each other!** <br />
- We share the information about new test-nets: DVS-Validators have an access to *DVS Discord Server*, that agregate information about new projects and test-nets <br />
- We help to join existing main-nets: DVS will help you with advice, documentation, as well as tokens for running a validator in networks that are validated by DVS. <br />
- We care about each other, like about ourselvs: DVS-Validators take on reputational and financial risks in the case of a mistake or unforeseen circumstances. <br />

**And of course, this is good reputation and new perspective for validator!** <br />
When you want to join new test-net, you are not just lonely enthusiast any more - you are the part of Decentralized Autonomus Synchronization! <br />
It means, that projects will understand, that they will get a validator that is supported by many other validators, and in case of unforeseen circumstances, the Network and delegators will receive compensation for any lose. <br />

## We are responsible for our actions!

DVS has its own fund, which is created by DVS-validators. <br />
The fund is replenished from funds of DVS-validators. <br />
Funds are used to cover losses associated with mistakes and unforeseen circumstances. <br />
The validator has the right to take a part of the fund for itself in case of leaving DVS. <br />

## Minimum requirements for DVS-Validators

If you wand to become a part of DVS, you need: <br />
- Share ideas of Decentralization and keep digital friendship with other validators <br />
- Take care of cyber-security <br />
- Care about interests of the Network and Delegators, as about your own interests <br />

## What to expect in the near future?

- Launching of DAS with own governance token <br />
- Participation in the validating of the blockchain with Proof-of-Time <br />
- Digital marketing from the DVS, that will help focus on validation, not on spreading information about your own validator <br />
